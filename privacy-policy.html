    <h2>2.1 Special Permissions and Data for Parental Control</h2>
    <p>As a parental control application, DiriCode utilizes specific Android permissions and APIs to deliver its core functionalities. We obtain explicit and informed consent from parents/guardians before enabling these features.</p>

    <h3>Accessibility Service API:</h3>
    <p>DiriCode uses the Android AccessibilityService API (android.permission.BIND_ACCESSIBILITY_SERVICE) on the child's device to enable critical parental control features. This API is used for the following purposes:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>App Blocking:</strong> To detect when a child attempts to launch an application designated as blocked by the parent and to prevent its use.</li>
        <li><strong>Screen Time Limits:</strong> To enforce time limits set by the parent on specific applications or overall device usage.</li>
        <li><strong>Uninstall Protection:</strong> To prevent the unauthorized uninstallation of the DiriCode application, ensuring continuous parental oversight.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>This service processes app launch events and package names of foreground applications solely for the purpose of triggering blocking actions and enforcing parental rules. It does not collect personal content, modify user settings without consent, or circumvent Android's built-in privacy controls. Parental consent is explicitly obtained in-app before this service is activated.</p>

    <h3>Usage Stats API ('PACKAGE_USAGE_STATS'):</h3>
    <p>DiriCode requires the <code>android.permission.PACKAGE_USAGE_STATS</code> permission to collect information about application usage times and patterns on the child's device. This data includes which applications are used and for how long.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Purpose:</strong> This data is vital for providing parents with comprehensive reports and insights into their child's device activity, enabling them to understand and manage their child's digital habits effectively.</li>
        <li><strong>Usage:</strong> Collected usage data is securely transmitted to our cloud servers (Firebase Firestore) and is linked only to the associated parent's account. It is not shared with third parties for advertising, profiling, or any other unrelated purposes. Parental consent is explicitly obtained in-app before accessing this data.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Location Data (Expanded from point 6):</h3>
    <p>When the "Find Phone (child location)" feature is enabled by the parent, DiriCode collects the device's precise (and/or coarse) location (using <code>android.permission.ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION</code>, <code>android.permission.ACCESS_COARSE_LOCATION</code>, and <code>android.permission.ACCESS_BACKGROUND_LOCATION</code>).</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Purpose:</strong> This data is collected to provide real-time location tracking for the child's device, enabling parents to locate their child for safety and oversight.</li>
        <li><strong>Usage:</strong> Location coordinates and associated timestamps are securely stored on our Firebase Firestore servers and are accessible only to the parent associated with the child's account. This data is not used for advertising or shared with unrelated third parties. Parental consent is explicitly obtained for location tracking.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>2.2 Children's Privacy</h2>
    <p>DiriCode is a parental control application designed for parents to manage and monitor their children's device usage and ensure a safe digital environment. We understand the importance of protecting children's online privacy.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>We do not directly collect personal information from children without the verifiable consent of a parent or guardian.</li>
        <li>All data collected on a child's device through DiriCode (including app usage, app blocking events, and location data) is done under the express consent and control of the parent or guardian who sets up and manages the DiriCode account.</li>
        <li>Parents have full control over what data is collected from their child's device and can access, modify, or delete this data at any time through their DiriCode account.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3 How long we keep your personal data</h2>
    <p>We will keep your personal data for as long as it is reasonably necessary. It will depend on factors such as whether you have an account with us or have interacted with us.</p>
    <p>Your personal data will be deleted or anonymized when it is no longer needed for its originally stated processing purposes or for any additional purpose for which we may lawfully further process such data.</p>

    <h2>4 Sharing of your personal data</h2>
    <p>We do not sell, lease, rent or give away your personal data except under the circumstances set out below:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>We may share your personal data with other members of our group of companies so we can provide the best services across our group. They are bound to keep your information in accordance with this policy.</li>
        <li>We may also share your personal data with certain contractors or service providers. They will process your personal data on behalf of us, for example, database service providers, advertising agencies, or customer relation management service providers. Our contractors and service providers will be required to meet our standards on processing data and security. The information we provide to them, including your personal data, will only be provided in connection with the performance of their functions.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Your personal data may be disclosed or transferred to other third-party organisations under the following circumstances:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>If we are discussing selling or transferring part or all of our business – your personal data may be transferred to prospective purchasers under suitable terms as to confidentiality.</li>
        <li>If we are reorganised or sold, your personal data may be transferred to a buyer who can continue to provide the Services to you.</li>
        <li>If we are required to by law, or under any regulatory code or practice we follow, or if we are asked by any public or regulatory authority to disclose your personal data.</li>
        <li>If we are defending a legal claim, your personal data may be disclosed or transferred as required in connection with defending such claim.</li>
        <li>If we have obtained your explicit consent in advance.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Your personal data may be shared if it is made anonymous and aggregated, as in such circumstances the anonymized data will cease to be personal data.</p>

    <h2>5 Where your personal data will be stored</h2>
    <p>Your personal data may be stored and processed in a country or jurisdiction outside of your country of residence, and that country or jurisdiction may have data protection rules which are different from those of your country of residence.</p>
    <p>If we are to transfer your personal data out of your country of residence, we will endeavour to ensure that a similar degree of protection is afforded by putting in place adequate technical, organisational and legal measures.</p>
    <p>We store your personal data on cloud servers located across the world. We will only transfer your personal data to jurisdictions outside the scope of the European General Data Protection Regulation (the "GDPR") where the appropriate safeguards set out in the GDPR are in place.</p>
